# Minimalist RSS Reader

> This is a work in progress project currently.

The application aims to show you a list of your favorite subscriptions sorted by the preference you configure.

It aims to help you grow in your quest for knowledge and at the same time bore you enough, such that you go back to doing more focussed work.


### Development

- Open up the diagram at root of this project
- Start local version using `npm start`
- You will also need to start CORS everywhere using `npm run proxy` (this is a seperate project)
